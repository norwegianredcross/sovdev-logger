# Setup Mac for devcontainer

You can follow the instructions on the [Installing Rancher Desktop on macOS
page](https://docs.rancherdesktop.io/getting-started/installation/#installing-rancher-desktop-on-macos)
to install Rancher Desktop

If you want to do it simpler you should install [Rancher Desktop via Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/cask/rancher)

```bash
brew install --cask rancher
```

If you have a Mac and dont use Homebrew you should consider installing it. It is a package manager that makes it easy to install and manage software on macOS. You can find more information about Homebrew [here](https://brew.sh/).

After you have installed Rancher Desktop start it. Then you can continue on the windows setup page [Test the docker functionality](setup-windows.md#test-the-docker-functionality)
